Pushed a lyric scraping script that would allow for an index containing song lyrics from various artists from Genius. Made sure the results are printed nicely in a txt file with the artist and song name at the top of each song.

Combined the song lyric index and our relevance ranked search infrastructure with the flask demo to create a web UI for the search. Added Bootstrap and CSS to make the formatting of the web UI nicer.

Removed the unnecessary Boolean search elements from our code and replaced them with just the necessary tfv5 variable. This ensures that when the search query is processed, it is processed using the right variables. Also tried to figure out what's wrong with the KWIC feature but cannot get it to run for some reason.

Tried to fix the bug that causes no results to be displayed when the query is identical to the name of the artist or the song. Could not achieve this. Then I moved on to the theme extraction and added this feature to our search engine. It seems to work fine and displays the 5 top themes in the lyrics index.
