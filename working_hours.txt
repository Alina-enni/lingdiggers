Pushed a lyric scraping script that would allow for an index containing song lyrics from various artists from Genius. Made sure the results are printed nicely in a txt file with the artist and song name at the top of each song.

Combined the song lyric index and our relevance ranked search infrastructure with the flask demo to create a web UI for the search. Added Bootstrap and CSS to make the formatting of the web UI nicer.
