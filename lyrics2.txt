The Scientist Lyrics
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Viva la Vida Lyrics
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
My missionaries in a foreign field
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
For some reason, I can't explain
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Yellow Lyrics
Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along, I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

(Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across, I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line, I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

(Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do158Embed

Fix You Lyrics
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you147Embed

Hymn for the Weekend Lyrics
And said drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
That we shoot across the sky
Pour on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I, Oh-I, Oh-I
I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot)
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...63Embed

Cornflake Girl Lyrics
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us a yo-heave-ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time

This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love
This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
A-ha, rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys
Where'd you put the keys, girl?

And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much

And the man with the golden gun

Slag pit, stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips, yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We gotta be big, boy, we gotta be big

Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like my daddy, yes
Gonna strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
Running in the family

Rest your shoulders, peaches and cream
Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see
Beautiful angel calling
We got every re-run of Muhammad Ali

Prism perfect
Honey bring it close to your lips, yes
What is termed a landslide of principle proportion, boy?
It's gotta be big, I said it better be big, hey, hey
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes

Winter Lyrics
Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
I put my hand in my father's glove
I run off where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown
I hear a voice: "You must learn to stand up
For yourself, cause I can't always be around"

He says:
"When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear"

Boys get discovered as winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was
Mirror mirror, where's the crystal palace?
But I only can see myself
Skating around the truth who I am
But I know that the ice is getting thin
"When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear"

Hair is grey and the fires are burning
So many dreams on the shelf
You say "I wanted you to be proud of me"
I always wanted that myself

"When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses have gone ahead
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear"

Never change
All the white horses, ah

Silent All These Years Lyrics
Excuse me, but can I be you for a while?
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the Antichrist in the kitchen yelling at me again
Yeah, I can hear that
Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say, you know but nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Yeah, I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these years

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?
My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these

Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Till finally, there is nothing left?
One more casualty, you know
We're too easy, easy, easy

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice
I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years

I've been here
Silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these yearsEmbed

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time, but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

Girls & Boys Lyrics
Streets like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the '90s
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for

Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Avoiding all work
'Cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr schön
But we haven't been introduced
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Looking for girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love

Parklife Lyrics
Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as (Parklife!)
And morning soup can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is known as (Parklife!)
John's got brewer's droop, he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons, they love a bit of it (Parklife!)
Who's that gut lord marching? You should cut down on your pork life mate, get some exercise

All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
Know what I mean?

I get up when I want, except on Wednesdays when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen (Parklife!)
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea and I think about leaving me house (Parklife!)
I feed the pigeons, I sometimes feed the sparrows too, it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing (Parklife!)
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it

All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife

Parklife (Parklife!)
Parklife (Parklife!)
It's got nothing to do with your Vorsprung durch Technik, you know
Parklife (Parklife!)
And it's not about you joggers who go 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Parklife (Parklife!)
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife15Embed

Coffee & TV Lyrics
Do you feel like a chainstore?
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around, bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
There's people there who will hurt you
Because of who you are
Your ears are full of the language
There's wisdom there, you're sure
Until the words start slurring
And you can't find the door
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again


So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me

Taylor Swift
All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it186Embed

​cardigan Lyrics
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite153Embed

​exile Lyrics
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Ooh, ooh, ooh

I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign

Lover Lyrics
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover123Embed

​the 1 Lyrics
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)93Embed

Hate Me Lyrics
(If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me)

(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you
For you
For you

If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

I Hope You’re Happy LyricsThere will be days when you're falling down
There will be days when you're inside out
There will be days when you fall apart
Someone else will break your heart
They're never gonna hold you back
I'm always gonna have your back
So try to remember that
I hope you're happy
I hope you're good
I hope you get what you wish for
And you're well-understood
And now I'm standing here, looking at you
I wonder what the hell you're gonna do
With those Dr. Pepper eyes and your bubble gum hair
Yeah, I'm standing right here
I remember how I held you so right
I remember that Saturday night
Do you?
There will be days when you're falling down
There will be days when you're inside out
There will be days when you fall apart
Someone else will break your heart
They're never gonna hold you back
I'm always gonna have your back
So try to remember that
I hope you're happy
I hope you're good
I hope you get what you wish for
And you're well-understood
And whatever your progress
I know you'll be fine
Because I hope you're happy
Even if you're not mine
I remember when the world was ours to take
I remember you next to me
I remember you with every breath I take
You'll always have a piece of me
I remember, yeah
Try to remember that
I remember every word that we spoke
You right here next to me
I remember how we tried and we tried
I remember everything
Try to remember that
That I hope you're happy
That I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy
I hope you're good
I hope you get what you wish for
And you're well-understood
And whatever your progress
I know you'll be fine
Because I hope you're happy
Even if you're not mine
Try to remember that
I hope you're happy5Embed

Into The Ocean Lyrics
I'm just a normal boy
That sank when I fell overboard
My ship would leave the country
But I'd rather swim ashore
Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again
Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim
(Like fourteen miles away)
Now floating up and down
I spin, colliding into sound
Like whales beneath me diving down
I'm sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out
The lighthouse beam has just run out
I'm cold as cold as cold can be
Be

I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Where is the coastguard?
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life believe me
(How can I keep up this breathing?)
Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending?
I thought of just your face
Relaxed, and floated into space

I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Now waking to the sun
I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow, yeah
Just to prove that I knew how, yeah
It's midnight's late reminder of
The loss of her, the one I love
My will to quickly end it all
Set front row in my need to fall
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all

Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)

I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Into space
I thought of just your face17Embed

Calling You Lyrics
There's something that I can't quite explain
I'm so in love with you
You'll never take that away
And if I've said it a hundred times before
Expect a thousand more
You'll never take that away

Well expect me to be
Calling you to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking "if you love me"
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me

I thought that the world had lost it's sway
(It's so hard sometimes)
Then I fell in love with you
(Then came you)
And you took that away
(It's not so difficult)
(The world is not so difficult)
You take away the old
Show me the new
And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
A hundred miles from home
I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you
I only want to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking "if you love me"
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me8Embed

The Worry List LyricsI'm tired, twisted, barely breathing, buried in the dark...
A could've been
Don't be concerned, that's just the power of a breaking heart...
How good am I hiding it?
Look, I've got some bad intentions; guilty as fucking charged
Still standing stable, more than able, 'cause I know who you are
I know the birthdays, anniversaries, all the first days I missed
I regret them all, but, but now I know this;
I know that God exists,I held her in my arms
I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
I'm really fine, and Mar, there's nothing we haven't talked about
So take me off your worry list, I said "throw it away"
Yeah, this is what my life is about
I might've been gone, but I never walked out
I've taken a thousand red eyes to change your point of view
Of what kind of man would take the trust you break
And still follow through
'Cause I'm standing right here and you may not show up
Our same gate 14 where honestly, I'm just sick of calling your bluff
And it's just embarrassing that I nearly threw up
While I'm trying hard to change the things I always screw up
And at the top of my list, this visitation is no relationship
But I've got to make the best of it, 'cause I know;
I know that God exists, I held her in my arms
I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
And I'm doing fine and I got plenty of friends around
Take me off your worry list, just throw it away
Well, it's time to stand up on my own for her
'Cause I'm packing it up, and I'm coming today
I couldn't wait to finally pick my family up
Everything is quiet and covered in snow
There's something wrong here, nobody's at home
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Now, I'm back in the driver's seat, heading back home
Yeah, back to Texas on my own
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
And I'm doing fine and I got plenty of friends around
Take me off your worry list, just throw it away
It's time to stand up on my own for her
I'm packing it up and I'm coming today
This is what my story's about
I might have been gone, but I never walked out
I'm packing it up and I'm coming today
This is what your story's about
My pretty little girl, can you figure it out?
If it helps to know, so there is no doubt
Just listen to the stories, not everything is glorious
Some hurt, some love, some shout
I fought the world and I lost that bout
And you are what my album's about
I might've been gone, but I never walked out2Embed

Trains Lyrics
Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A sixty ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides, I'm in luck
When the evening reaches here you're tying me up
I'm dying of love, it's OK

When I hear the engine pass I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides, I'm in luck
When the evening reaches here you're tying me up
I'm dying of love, it's OK

(Always the summers are slipping away)

Always the summers are slipping away16Embed

Lazarus LyricsAs the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head breaks the analog
And says:
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said:
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
"My David, don't you worry
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you"
Ghosts of the twenties rising
Golden summers just holding you
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Come to us, Lazarus
It's time for you to go"12Embed

Arriving Somewhere But Not Here Lyrics
Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river rushing through your ears
Arriving somewhere, but not here

Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song?
Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
And all of my dreams, sacrificed


Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Ever thought from here on in your life begins and all you knew was wrong?
Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
And all of my dreams...

Did you see the red mist block your path?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart?
Arriving somewhere, but not here13Embed

Blackest Eyes Lyrics
A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy
A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your makeup runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes

A few minutes with me inside my van
Should be so beautiful if we can
I'm feeling something taking over me

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes
I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes3Embed

Fear of a Blank Planet Lyrics
Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blind to let it inside
The bed is unmade, some music still plays
TV, yeah it's always on
The flicker of the screen, a movie actress screams
I'm basking in the shit flowing out of it

I'm stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing
X-Box is a god to me
A finger on the switch, my mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me


Don't try engaging me
The vaguest of shrugs, the prescription drugs
So you'll never find a person inside
My face is mogadon
Curiosity has given up on me
I'm tuning out desires, the pills are on the rise
How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

I'm through with pornography
The acting is lame, the action is tame
Explicitly dull, arousal annulled
Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day with nothing to say
Your shallow proclamations all misinformation

My friend says he wants to die
He's in a band - they sound like Pearl Jam
The clothes are all black, the music is crap
In school I don't concentrate
And sex is kinda fun but just another one
Of all the empty ways of using up a day

How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom


You don't try
To be liked
You don't mind
You feel no sun
You steal a gun
To kill time
You're somewhere
You're nowhere
You don't care
You catch the breeze
You still the leaves
So now where?10Embed

Uprising Lyrics
Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve, mmm
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you mean

And now I need to know, is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? Mmm
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you need

But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no (expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized (realized)
I need to love
I need to love

Come to me, just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know I can be wrong
Baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...

Pressure Lyrics
I'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially
I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out
​
Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building

Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me get off the ground (Don't push me)
To you I'm no longer bound (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't stop me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't choke me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

I'm feeling the pressure
I can't break out
No one can hear me scream and shout
Get out of my face, out of my mind
I see your corruption
I'm not blind
I'll carry the burden and take the strain
And when I am done I will make you pay
Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building

Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me get off the ground (Don't push me)
To you I'm no longer bound (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't curb me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't thwart me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

Don't block me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

Supermassive Black Hole Lyrics
Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?

Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive

I thought I was a fool for no one
But ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
And how long before you tell the truth?

Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole


Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)

Starlight Lyrics
Far away
This ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive

I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

Far away
This ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

I'll never let you go
If you promise not to
Fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

I just wanted to hold35Embed

No More “I Love You’s” Lyrics
I used to be a lunatic from the gracious days
I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed for you to see

Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
(The lover speaks about the monsters)

I used to have demons in my room at night
Desire, despair, desire
So many monsters

Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence

No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word

(And people are being real crazy
But we will only come
And you know what, mommy?
Everybody was being real crazy
The monsters are crazy
There are monsters outside)

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence

No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
Outside the words
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me

No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
Outside the world3Embed

Into the West Lyrics
Lay down
Your sweet and weary head
Night is falling
You have come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore
Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass
Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say we have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again
And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
Grey ships pass
Into the West4Embed

Why Lyrics
Why?
Why?

How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done?
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
"Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun"
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth

Tell me
Why?
Why?

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking?
This boat is sinking (this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out
Turning inside out
Tell me
Why?
Tell me
Why?

(Why?) This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
(Why?) This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head
(Why?) And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
‘Cause I don't think you how I feel
I don't think you know what I fear
(Why?) I don't think you know what I fear
You don't know what I fear2Embed

Walking on Broken Glass Lyrics
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

You were the sweetest thing
That I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar, honey
If I can't have you
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo, yeah)
Walking on, walking on broken glass

The sun's still shining in the big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me
Ohoh, let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me
I'm living in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo)

And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well my dear

Now every one of us was made to suffer
Every one of us was made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
I can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
Keep on walking on broken glass

Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass2Embed

Fly Me to the Moon Lyrics
Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you


Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you94Embed

My Way Lyrics
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way64Embed

That’s Life Lyrics
That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinning around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my18Embed

New York, New York Lyrics
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York

I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

These little town blues, are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York

If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one

These little town blues, oh, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York17Embed

The Girl From Ipanema (Garota De Ipanema) Lyrics
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes  "ooh"

But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
(doesn't see)

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
A coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

Ooh, but I watch her so sadly

Ah, Porque tudo to triste

Yes, I would give my heart gladly

But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see

Nem olha para mim

She never sees me

Por causa do amor3Embed

Space Oddity Lyrics

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

“Heroes” Lyrics
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day84Embed

★ (Blackstar) Lyrics
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes

Ah-ah-ah

In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar)
​
I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a filmstar)
I'ma take you home (I'm a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a blackstar)
You're a flash in the pan (I'm not a marvel star)
I'm the Great I Am (I'm a blackstar)
​
I'm a blackstar, way up, on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a star's star, I'm a blackstar)
I can't answer why (I'm not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flam star)
We were born upside-down (I'm a star's star)
Born the wrong way 'round (I’m not a white star)
I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar
I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar
I'm not a pornstar, I'm not a wandering star
I'm a blackstar, I’m a blackstar

In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
On the day of execution, only women kneel and smile

At the centre of it all, your eyes, your eyes

Starman Lyrics
Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Life on Mars? Lyrics
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?105Embed

Your Song Lyrics
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world53Embed

Rocket Man (I Think It’s Going to Be a Long, Long Time) Lyrics
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time58Embed

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Lyrics
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah22Embed

Bennie and the Jets Lyrics
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets

Tiny Dancer Lyrics
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Eat, Sleep, Wake (Nothing But You) Lyrics
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you

It's so cold in the air, put the bud in my ear, first note start
I can see where you are, dream where you are
Will the song never end?
Us on the bed half a meter apart

Awkward hearts beating faster and faster, faster and faster
We'll cut through the park, stick to the path
I can't stick to the path, 'cause I dream about nothing but you

Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, nothing but you, nothing but you

I may not say it outwardly
So all I have are memories
Those looks at the start, the words in the dark
But never a flame, we just wanted the spark
Awkward hearts beating faster and faster, faster and faster
We'll cut through the park, stick to the path
I can't stick to the path, 'cause I dream about nothing but you

Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Nothing but you
Nothing but you

Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, nothing but you, nothing but you, nothing but you3Embed

Luna Lyrics
I will bathe myself
Then I'll wear you for the night
Colours fading, frayed at the sides
(You're changing in the light)
Oh why is your face so pale and white?

There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

Now the night has fled
Just like everything I'd said
When the moon was out instead
(Now the sun glows soft and red)
You burn through my mind
Again and again, again, again
And again and again

There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out

Always Like This Lyrics
Oh, she can wait
For what I can give
She knows what I am but
She won’t believe me
Is it all okay?
Will I come off the lightest?
I can’t believe it
It’s always like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this)
Kept it at bay
Yes, you kept your words
There on your mouth
But it’s not what I heard
If I follow the light
That I deem the brightest
I won’t believe that
It’s always like this

(No, no, no...)
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I'm not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone
Oh, you can wait
For what I can give
You know what I am
So you know how I live
Try to look proud
But you’re not in the slightest
It's happening now
And it’s always been like this
(Like this, like this, like this...)

I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone14Embed

Lights Out, Words Gone Lyrics
Keep your old and wasted word
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on

Can you feel the leeches bite
That boy that she took out tonight
He's brave and walking sure
Through all the spots you're working for

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on

Shuffle Lyrics
Weight is coming off, soaring high
Pleading you to stay, come alive

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?

Fading at the light
Softly say
Get it out my mind anyway

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'Till it's gone?

You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
(Running out
You can make it through it
Running out
You can make it all)

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call (say you)
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor (say you)
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'Till it's gone?11Embed

Lola Lyrics
I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"
L-O-L-A, Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, "Little boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well, I almost fell for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Well, I looked at her, and she at me

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man"
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola

Waterloo Sunset Lyrics
Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright

But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night

But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Millions of people swarming like flies
Round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound

And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

Waterloo sunset's fine14Embed

The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama tryna break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Tellin' tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now I'm sittin' here
Sippin' at my ice-cold beer
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well, give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama tryna break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury

Strangers Lyrics
Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things that I own I will share with you
And, if I feel tomorrow, like, I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And, if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one6Embed

Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around
Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying (What did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own

Don't try to change me you're wasting your time
Now I've got something much better in mind

Love in the First Degree LyricsLast night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
When I woke up I was screaming
Calling out your name (whoa)
And the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me (the blame on me)
They wanna tell from my story
They want to hear my plea
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty (guilty)
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree
(Guilty) Of love in the first degree
Someday I'm believing
You will come to my rescue
Unchain my heart, you'll keep him
Let me start a new (you)
The hours passed so slowly
Since they've thrown away the key (away the key)
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty (guilty)
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree
(Guilty) Of Love in the first degree
(Guilty)
Of Love
(Guilty)
Of Love in
(Guilty) Of Love
(Guilty) Of Love in
(Guilty)
Of love in the first degree
And the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me
They wanna tell from my story
They wanna hear my plea
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty (Guilty)
As a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degreeEmbed

I Heard a Rumour LyricsWho needs friends who never show
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
Those lonely nights
(I'm just thinking about when I waited)
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out
All my friends were right
('Til I found out, ooh, ooh)
I didn't know you at all
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, ooh
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
Baby, I'm too afraid
So you realise what hurt you made
(So you realise the love)
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
(How can I forgive, ooh, ooh)
It's never gonna be the same
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, oohEmbed

Take Me Out Lyrics
So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
I say you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say: take me out


Well, I say you don't know
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you51Embed

Love Illumination Lyrics
When you're half way from a dream
Is it hard to work out what is real?
Is the real over there
More vivid than here ever feels?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright
You'll be alright

Is the Blackpool bright light
Brighter than the light in your home?
Were you born to be loved
But nobody else seems to know?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason term
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright


We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody
We're all looking for (All looking for)
Somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright

Sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet love5Embed

The Dark of the Matinée Lyrics
Take your white finger
Slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer
Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties
And I'm not to look at you in the shoe
But the eyes find the eyes

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine

Time every journey to bump into you accidentally
I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate, all the girls I hate
All the words I hate, all the clothes I hate
How I'll never be anything I hate
You smile, mention something that you like
Oh, how you'd have a happy life if you did the things you like

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine
So I'm on BBC Two now
Telling Terry Wogan how I made it
And what I made is unclear now
But his deference is and his laughter is
My words and smile are so easy now
Yes, it's easy now
Yes, it's easy now

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
You will find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
Better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine7Embed

Always Ascending Lyrics
(Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down)
Don’t be concerned
It’s just the way that gravity works 'round here
All slowly rising, falling patiently
Feel no, feel no fear
Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"
But go
Let go

Always and always and always ascending
The opening line leaves an uncertain ending
Always and always and always ascending
The chords seem to pause, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon, talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh, oh
Yeah, wake me up
C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry, waking up dusty
Feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup, bring me water
We can ascend from this arrangement
We can see fate as entertainment
Bring me a cup, bring me water
Bring me water

Always and always and always ascending
The Shepard misleads so you think you’re transcending
Always and always and always ascending
Pause the progression, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon, talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh, oh
Yeah, wake me up
C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry, waking up dusty
Feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup, bring me water
Yeah, bring me water, yeah, bring me water
Bring me water, bring me water, yeah

(Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down)
Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"
But go
Let go3Embed

Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God) Lyrics
It doesn't hurt me (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to feel how it feels? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building (Iyoh)
Say, if I only could, oh

You (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Iyeh-yeh-yo)

Oh come on, baby (Iyeh)
Oh come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh, uh-oh
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill

Wuthering Heights Lyrics
Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master
Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, let me have it!
Let me grab your soul away
Ooh, let me have it!
Let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy!

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold...

Babooshka Lyrics
Babooshka
Babooshka

She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do:
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worse move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter:

"All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya"

Babooshka
She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go
To see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out:

"I'm all yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya"
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya

This Woman’s Work Lyrics
Pray God you can cope
I stand outside this woman's work
This woman's world
Ooh, it's hard on the man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the father

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying, but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things I should've said
That I never said
All the things we should've done
That we never did
All the things I should've given
But I didn't
Oh, darling, make it go
Make it go away
Give me these moments back
Give them back to me
Give me that little kiss
Give me your hand

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying, but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things we should've said
That were never said
All the things we should've done
That we never did
All the things that you needed from me
All the things that you wanted for me
All the things that I should've given but I didn't
Oh, darling, make it go away
Just make it go away now11Embed

Cloudbusting Lyrics
I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark
What made it special
Made it dangerous
So I bury it
And forget

But every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small
In their big black car
To be a threat to the men in power
I hid my yo-yo
In the garden
I can't hide you
From the government
Oh, God, Daddy
I won't forget

'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen


And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, oh
Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
"We're cloudbusting, daddy"
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo

The sun's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Your son's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo20Embed

Mathematics Lyrics

Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands left
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the "cha-pow!" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a key
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you at PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
It's mathematics
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science"
"What are we talking about here?"
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science"
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math, do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"

Yo, it's 1 universal law, but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you biddin' for life, mandatory
4 MC's murdered in the last 4 years
I ain't trying to be the 5th when the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 million ways to die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for "Who is" and "Who ain't niggas"
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it
It's all mathematics
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science.."
"What are we talking about here?"
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"

Ms. Fat Booty Lyrics
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

Man, duke, I was in love with this girl,, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name, love? Where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, "Yo, I'm leavin' now"
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
"A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce"
I turned around (Say word!)
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin'? "Oh, I'm fine", my name is Mos "I'm Sharice"
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, "How you gon' leave before you dance with me?"
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though
I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just..
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..

"Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right"
I understand, I'm feelin' you
Besides, "Can I have a dance?" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, "Honey, let's exchange numbers"
Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs
Like, "If I don't, if I don't have you"
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man, I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., "Come now", I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic
Aww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin' ass Asian playin' lay it down and lick me up
What!?46Embed

Yo, the way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face, but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus
The focus get cleared then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly, sometimes y'all don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I'm hardly ever 'sleep, my flow forever deep
And it's volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere; penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life
Holla, black, you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren
I swing 'round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant
Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas tryin' to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
Then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind 'em
It's everywhere; penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life
Holla, black, you know it well
What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is!
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is!

Ecstatic! (En punto)
Peace, power
Fantastic
So original
And always on time and rockin' ya mind (Ruler!)

Sit and come relax, riddle of the mac
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well, say, about noon-ish, comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carryin' laundry, "What's wrong, G? Hungry?"
"No, gimme my oil or get  out my country"
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff ("Jihad!")
'Til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feelin' like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, "Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!" (Bye!)
Buyin' apples, I'm breakin' on, "You take everythin'
Why not just take the damn food, black bastard?"
I don't understand it, on another planet?
15-months of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasin' the sentiment, gentlemen
Gettin' down on their Middle Eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crap
Walk over, kicked one of my fabulous raps ("La-Di-Da-Di")
Arab jaw drop, they well wish, they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad
Omar: Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries
Ali: They sent you?
Omar: Yeah, so? Here

What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you know, here it is45Embed

Hip Hop Lyrics
You say "one for the treble, two for the time"
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say "one for the treble, two for the time"
Come on!
Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, (huh!)

My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
From the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)
Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-ga-lish
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunItion
(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you16Embed

UMI Says Lyrics
I don't wanna write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now
I don't wanna take no time to write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now, hey (World premiere)
Tomorrow may never come
For you or me, life is not promised
Tomorrow may never show up
For you and me, this life is not promised
I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can
With what it is I have
I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can
With what it is I have

Put my heart and soul into this song
I hope you feel me
From where I am, to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely
Tomorrow may never come
For you and me, life is not promised
Tomorrow may never appear
You better hold this very moment very close to you
Very close to you, so close to you
So close to you, don't be afraid, just let it shine
My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see

Sometimes I get discouraged
I look around and, things are so weak
People are so weak
Sometimes, sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away (Like a dove)
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself
Passion takes over me
I feel like a man, going insane, losing my brain
Trying to maintain, doing my thang
Put my heart and soul into this y'all
I hope you feel me where I am, to wherever you are
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life, with
Me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes I don't want to get into no war
Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but
My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Jiddo said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My elders said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see

I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All my people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me

Black people unite and let's all get down
Gotta have what
Gotta have that love
Peace and understanding
One God, one light
One man, one voice, one mic
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and get down
Gotta have what
Love, peace and understanding
One God, one voice, one life
One man, gon' shine my light
Black people unite, now hop up and do it right
Black people unite, now come on and do it right
Yeah baby that's what I like
Yeah baby that's what I like
Black people
My people
Black people
My people
My people
My people27Embed

Dreams Lyrics

Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know81Embed

The Chain Lyrics
Fuck

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)


(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow51Embed

Landslide Lyrics
I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too


Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too
I take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down54Embed

Silver Springs Lyrics
You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

Don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me17Embed

Rhiannon Lyrics
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
Rhiannon

And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
