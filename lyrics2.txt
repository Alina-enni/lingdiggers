The Scientist Lyrics
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Viva la Vida Lyrics
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
My missionaries in a foreign field
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
For some reason, I can't explain
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm

Yellow Lyrics
Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along, I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

(Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across, I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line, I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

(Aah) Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
(Ooh) Turn into something beautiful
(Aah) And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true, look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

Fix You Lyrics
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Hymn for the Weekend Lyrics
And said drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
That we shoot across the sky
Pour on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I, Oh-I, Oh-I
I’m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I, Oh-I, Oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high

That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the...
That I shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the... (Let me shoot)
Let me shoot across the sky
Let me shoot across the...
Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...

Cornflake Girl Lyrics
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us a yo-heave-ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time

This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love
This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
A-ha, rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys
Where'd you put the keys, girl?

And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
(I know it's so easy)
And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah

And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah

And the man with the golden gun

Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah

Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
All this time, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?

Professional Widow Lyrics
Slag pit, stag shit
Honey bring it close to my lips, yes
Don't blow those brains yet
We gotta be big, boy, we gotta be big

Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like my daddy, yes
Gonna strike a deal
Make him feel like a congressman
Running in the family
It's running a family

Rest your shoulders, peaches and cream
Everywhere a Judas as far as you can see
Beautiful angel calling
We got every re-run of Muhammad Ali

Prism perfect
Honey bring it close to your lips, yes
What is termed a landslide of principle proportion, boy?
It's gotta be big, I said it better be big, hey, hey
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Starfucker just like my daddy, yes
Selling his baby, yes
Just like your daddy, yes
Selling his baby
Gonna strike a deal

Brown may be sweeter, may be sweeter

Give me peace, love, peace, love
Give me peace, love and a hard cock

Winter Lyrics
Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
I put my hand in my father's glove
I run off where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown
I hear a voice: "You must learn to stand up
For yourself, cause I can't always be around"

He says:
"When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear"

Boys get discovered as winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was
Mirror mirror, where's the crystal palace?
But I only can see myself
Skating around the truth who I am
But I know that the ice is getting thin
"When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear"

Hair is grey and the fires are burning
So many dreams on the shelf
You say "I wanted you to be proud of me"
I always wanted that myself

"When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses have gone ahead
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear"

Never change
All the white horses, ah
Hmm

Silent All These Years Lyrics
Excuse me, but can I be you for a while?
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the Antichrist in the kitchen yelling at me again
Yeah, I can hear that
Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say, you know but nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Yeah, I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these years

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?
My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these

Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Till finally, there is nothing left?
One more casualty, you know
We're too easy, easy, easy

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice
I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years

I've been here
Silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these years

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time, but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy metal

Pleased to meet you

Girls & Boys Lyrics
Streets like a jungle
So call the police
Following the herd
Down to Greece
On holiday
Love in the '90s
Is paranoid
On sunny beaches
Take your chances
Looking for

Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love

Avoiding all work
'Cause there's none available
Like battery thinkers
Count your thoughts
On one, two, three, four, five fingers
Nothing is wasted
Only reproduced
You get nasty blisters
Du bist sehr schön
But we haven't been introduced
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Looking for girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone you really love
Girls who are boys who like boys to be girls
Who do boys like they're girls, who do girls like they're boys
Always should be someone to really love

Parklife Lyrics
Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as (Parklife!)
And morning soup can be avoided if you take a route straight through what is known as (Parklife!)
John's got brewer's droop, he gets intimidated by the dirty pigeons, they love a bit of it (Parklife!)
Who's that gut lord marching? You should cut down on your pork life mate, get some exercise

All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
Know what I mean?

I get up when I want, except on Wednesdays when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen (Parklife!)
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea and I think about leaving me house (Parklife!)
I feed the pigeons, I sometimes feed the sparrows too, it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing (Parklife!)
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day, safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it

All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife

Parklife (Parklife!)
Parklife (Parklife!)
It's got nothing to do with your Vorsprung durch Technik, you know
Parklife (Parklife!)
And it's not about you joggers who go 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Parklife (Parklife!)
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife
All the people
So many people
And they all go hand in hand
Hand in hand through their parklife

She's a gun
Now what you done
Beetlebum?
Get nothing done

Just get numb

And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
Nothing is wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone

Beetlebum
Because you're young
She's a gun
Now what you done
Beetlebum?
She'll suck your thumb
She'll make you cum
'Cause she's your gun
Now what you done
Beetlebum?
And when she lets me slip away
She turns me on and all my violence gone
Nothing is wrong
I just slip away and I am gone
There's nothing wrong
She turns me on
I just slip away and I am gone

He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it
He's on, he's on, he's on it

Coffee & TV Lyrics
Do you feel like a chainstore?
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around, bored
Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
There's people there who will hurt you
Because of who you are
Your ears are full of the language
There's wisdom there, you're sure
Until the words start slurring
And you can't find the door
So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again


So give me coffee and TV
Easily
I've seen so much, I'm going blind
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big, bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again

Oh, we could start over again
Oh, we could start over again
Oh, we could start over again
Oh, we could start over again

All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

​cardigan Lyrics
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

​exile Lyrics
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Ooh, ooh, ooh

I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

Lover Lyrics
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

​the 1 Lyrics
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

Hate Me Lyrics
(If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me)

(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you
For you
For you

If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!
Hey, Justin!

I Hope You’re Happy Lyrics
There will be days when you're falling down
There will be days when you're inside out
There will be days when you fall apart
Someone else will break your heart
They're never gonna hold you back
I'm always gonna have your back
So try to remember that
I hope you're happy
I hope you're good
I hope you get what you wish for
And you're well-understood
And now I'm standing here, looking at you
I wonder what the hell you're gonna do
With those Dr. Pepper eyes and your bubble gum hair
Yeah, I'm standing right here
I remember how I held you so right
I remember that Saturday night
Do you?
There will be days when you're falling down
There will be days when you're inside out
There will be days when you fall apart
Someone else will break your heart
They're never gonna hold you back
I'm always gonna have your back
So try to remember that
I hope you're happy
I hope you're good
I hope you get what you wish for
And you're well-understood
And whatever your progress
I know you'll be fine
Because I hope you're happy
Even if you're not mine
I remember when the world was ours to take
I remember you next to me
I remember you with every breath I take
You'll always have a piece of me
I remember, yeah
Try to remember that
I remember every word that we spoke
You right here next to me
I remember how we tried and we tried
I remember everything
Try to remember that
That I hope you're happy
That I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy
I hope you're good
I hope you get what you wish for
And you're well-understood
And whatever your progress
I know you'll be fine
Because I hope you're happy
Even if you're not mine
Try to remember that
I hope you're happy

Into The Ocean Lyrics
I'm just a normal boy
That sank when I fell overboard
My ship would leave the country
But I'd rather swim ashore
Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again
Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim
(Like fourteen miles away)
Now floating up and down
I spin, colliding into sound
Like whales beneath me diving down
I'm sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out
The lighthouse beam has just run out
I'm cold as cold as cold can be
Be

I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Where is the coastguard?
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life believe me
(How can I keep up this breathing?)
Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending?
I thought of just your face
Relaxed, and floated into space

I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Now waking to the sun
I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow, yeah
Just to prove that I knew how, yeah
It's midnight's late reminder of
The loss of her, the one I love
My will to quickly end it all
Set front row in my need to fall
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all

Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)

I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down
Into space
I thought of just your face

Calling You Lyrics
There's something that I can't quite explain
I'm so in love with you
You'll never take that away
And if I've said it a hundred times before
Expect a thousand more
You'll never take that away

Well expect me to be
Calling you to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking "if you love me"
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me

I thought that the world had lost it's sway
(It's so hard sometimes)
Then I fell in love with you
(Then came you)
And you took that away
(It's not so difficult)
(The world is not so difficult)
You take away the old
Show me the new
And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you
So while I'm on this phone
A hundred miles from home
I'll take the words you gave me and send them back to you
I only want to see
If you're OK when I'm not around
Asking "if you love me"
I love the way you make it sound
Calling you to see
Do I try too hard to make you smile?
To make us smile

I will keep calling you to see
If you're sleeping, are you dreaming
If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me
I can't believe you actually picked me

The Worry List Lyrics
I'm tired, twisted, barely breathing, buried in the dark...
A could've been
Don't be concerned, that's just the power of a breaking heart...
How good am I hiding it?
Look, I've got some bad intentions; guilty as fucking charged
Still standing stable, more than able, 'cause I know who you are
I know the birthdays, anniversaries, all the first days I missed
I regret them all, but, but now I know this;
I know that God exists,I held her in my arms
I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
I'm really fine, and Mar, there's nothing we haven't talked about
So take me off your worry list, I said "throw it away"
Yeah, this is what my life is about
I might've been gone, but I never walked out
I've taken a thousand red eyes to change your point of view
Of what kind of man would take the trust you break
And still follow through
'Cause I'm standing right here and you may not show up
Our same gate 14 where honestly, I'm just sick of calling your bluff
And it's just embarrassing that I nearly threw up
While I'm trying hard to change the things I always screw up
And at the top of my list, this visitation is no relationship
But I've got to make the best of it, 'cause I know;
I know that God exists, I held her in my arms
I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
And I'm doing fine and I got plenty of friends around
Take me off your worry list, just throw it away
Well, it's time to stand up on my own for her
'Cause I'm packing it up, and I'm coming today
I couldn't wait to finally pick my family up
Everything is quiet and covered in snow
There's something wrong here, nobody's at home
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Now, I'm back in the driver's seat, heading back home
Yeah, back to Texas on my own
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way
And I'm doing fine and I got plenty of friends around
Take me off your worry list, just throw it away
It's time to stand up on my own for her
I'm packing it up and I'm coming today
This is what my story's about
I might have been gone, but I never walked out
I'm packing it up and I'm coming today
This is what your story's about
My pretty little girl, can you figure it out?
If it helps to know, so there is no doubt
Just listen to the stories, not everything is glorious
Some hurt, some love, some shout
I fought the world and I lost that bout
And you are what my album's about
I might've been gone, but I never walked out

Trains Lyrics
Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And I've heard the sound from my cousin's bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head

Always the summers are slipping away

A sixty ton angel falls to the earth
A pile of old metal, a radiant blur
Scars in the country, the summer and her

Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay

When I hear the engine pass I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides, I'm in luck
When the evening reaches here you're tying me up
I'm dying of love, it's OK

When I hear the engine pass I'm kissing you wide
The hissing subsides, I'm in luck
When the evening reaches here you're tying me up
I'm dying of love, it's OK

(Always the summers are slipping away)
(Find me a way for making it stay)
Always the summers are slipping away

Lazarus Lyrics
As the cheerless towns pass my window
I can see a washed out moon through the fog
And then a voice inside my head breaks the analog
And says:
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
I survived against the will of my twisted folk
But in the deafness of my world the silence broke
And said:
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul"
"My David, don't you worry
This cold world is not for you
So rest your head upon me
I have strength to carry you"
Ghosts of the twenties rising
Golden summers just holding you
"Follow me down to the valley below
You know
Moonlight is bleeding from out of your soul
Come to us, Lazarus
It's time for you to go"

Arriving Somewhere But Not Here Lyrics
Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river rushing through your ears
Arriving somewhere, but not here

Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song?
Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
And all of my dreams, sacrificed


Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Ever thought from here on in your life begins and all you knew was wrong?
Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
And all of my dreams...

Did you see the red mist block your path?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart?
Arriving somewhere, but not here

Blackest Eyes Lyrics
A mother sings a lullaby to a child
Sometime in the future the boy goes wild
And all his nerves are feeling some kind of energy
A walk in the woods and I will try
Something under the trees that made you cry
It's so erotic when your makeup runs

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes

A few minutes with me inside my van
Should be so beautiful if we can
I'm feeling something taking over me

I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes
I got wiring loose inside my head
I got books that I never ever read
I got secrets in my garden shed
I got a scar where all my urges bled
I got people underneath my bed
I got a place where all my dreams are dead
Swim with me into your blackest eyes

Fear of a Blank Planet Lyrics
Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blind to let it inside
The bed is unmade, some music still plays
TV, yeah it's always on
The flicker of the screen, a movie actress screams
I'm basking in the shit flowing out of it

I'm stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last year's thing
X-Box is a god to me
A finger on the switch, my mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me


Don't try engaging me
The vaguest of shrugs, the prescription drugs
So you'll never find a person inside
My face is mogadon
Curiosity has given up on me
I'm tuning out desires, the pills are on the rise
How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here

I'm through with pornography
The acting is lame, the action is tame
Explicitly dull, arousal annulled
Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day with nothing to say
Your shallow proclamations all misinformation

My friend says he wants to die
He's in a band - they sound like Pearl Jam
The clothes are all black, the music is crap
In school I don't concentrate
And sex is kinda fun but just another one
Of all the empty ways of using up a day

How can I be sure I'm here?
The pills that I've been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
There's nothing left, I simply am not here
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom
Bipolar disorder
Can't deal with the boredom


You don't try
To be liked
You don't mind
You feel no sun
You steal a gun
To kill time
You're somewhere
You're nowhere
You don't care
You catch the breeze
You still the leaves
So now where?

Uprising Lyrics
Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad

I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
And some kind of madness has started to evolve, mmm
And I, I tried so hard to let you go
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you mean

And now I need to know, is this real love
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? Mmm
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

And now I have finally seen the light
And I have finally realized what you need

But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
And I'm not expecting you to care, no (expecting you to care)
That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
And I have finally realized (realized)
I need to love
I need to love

Come to me, just in a dream
Come on and rescue me
Yes I know I can be wrong
Baby, you're too headstrong
Our love is...

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma mad mad mad

Pressure Lyrics
I'm trapped and my back's up against the wall
I see no solution or exit out
I'm grinding it out, no one can see
The pressure's growing exponentially
I'm trying to keep up to speed with you
Your lane changing is oscillating me
I'm hitting the ground and I'm sprinting
I'm falling behind now I'm tuning out
​
Pressure building
Pressure building
Pressure building

Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me get off the ground (Don't push me)
To you I'm no longer bound (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't stop me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't choke me (Ah-ah-ah)
I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

I'm feeling the pressure
I can't break out
No one can hear me scream and shout
Get out of my face, out of my mind
I see your corruption
I'm not blind
I'll carry the burden and take the strain
And when I am done I will make you pay
Pressure building

Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Don't push me (Ah-ah-ah)
Let me get off the ground (Don't push me)

Don't curb me (Ah-ah-ah)

You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

I need you out of my head (Don't push me)
You've got me close to the edge (Don't push me)

Supermassive Black Hole Lyrics
Ooh, baby, don't you know I suffer?
Ooh, baby, can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?

Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive

I thought I was a fool for no one
But ooh, baby, I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
And how long before you tell the truth?

Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Oooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole


Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the supermassive
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstar's sucked into the...
(Ooooooooooooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole

Starlight Lyrics
Far away
This ship is taking me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

Starlight
I will be chasing a starlight
Until the end of my life
I don't know if it's worth it anymore

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

My life
You electrify my life
Let's conspire to ignite
All the souls that would die just to feel alive

I'll never let you go
If you promise not to fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations

Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

Far away
This ship has taken me far away
Far away from the memories
Of the people who care if I live or die

I'll never let you go
If you promise not to
Fade away
Never fade away
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Our hopes and expectations
Black holes and revelations
Hold you in my arms
I just wanted to hold you in my arms

I just wanted to hold

No More “I Love You’s” Lyrics
I used to be a lunatic from the gracious days
I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed for you to see

Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
(The lover speaks about the monsters)

I used to have demons in my room at night
Desire, despair, desire
So many monsters

Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence

No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word

(And people are being real crazy
But we will only come
And you know what, mommy?
Everybody was being real crazy
The monsters are crazy
There are monsters outside)

No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence

No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
Outside the words
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me

No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
Outside the world

Into the West Lyrics
Lay down
Your sweet and weary head
Night is falling
You have come to journey's end
Sleep now
And dream of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across the distant shore
Why do you weep?
What are these tears upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping

What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass
Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say we have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again
And you'll be here in my arms
Just sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home

And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
Grey ships pass
Into the West

Why Lyrics
Why?
Why?

How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done?
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
"Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun"
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth

Tell me
Why?
Why?

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking?
This boat is sinking (this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out
Turning inside out
Tell me
Why?
Tell me
Why?

(Why?) This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
(Why?) This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head
(Why?) And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
‘Cause I don't think you how I feel
I don't think you know what I fear
(Why?) I don't think you know what I fear
You don't know what I fear

Walking on Broken Glass Lyrics
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

You were the sweetest thing
That I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar, honey
If I can't have you
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo, yeah)
Walking on, walking on broken glass

The sun's still shining in the big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me
Ohoh, let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me
I'm living in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass (Woohoo)

And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well my dear

Now every one of us was made to suffer
Every one of us was made to weep
But we've been hurting one another
And now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking (don't let me keep on walking)
I can't keep on walking (keep on walking on)
Keep on walking on broken glass

Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

Fly Me to the Moon Lyrics
Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you


Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you

My Way Lyrics
And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, oh, no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way

That’s Life Lyrics
That's life (That's life), that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said, that's life (That's life), and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks, stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world, it keeps spinning around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life (That's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought of quitting, baby
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down and over and out, and I know one thing
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face
I just pick myself up and get back in the race
That's life (That's life), that's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out but my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, my

New York, New York Lyrics
Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it: New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York

I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap

These little town blues, are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York

If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps
And find I'm a number one, top of the list
King of the hill, a number one

These little town blues, oh, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York
And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

The Girl From Ipanema (Garota De Ipanema) Lyrics
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes  "ooh"

But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
(doesn't see)

Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
A coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

Ooh, but I watch her so sadly

Ah, Porque tudo to triste

Yes, I would give my heart gladly

But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see

Nem olha para mim

She never sees me

Por causa do amor

Space Oddity Lyrics

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

“Heroes” Lyrics
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us just for one day
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

★ (Blackstar) Lyrics
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
​
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar)
​
I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a filmstar)
I'ma take you home (I'm a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a blackstar)
You're a flash in the pan (I'm not a marvel star)
I'm the Great I Am (I'm a blackstar)
​
I'm a blackstar, way up, on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a star's star, I'm a blackstar)
I can't answer why (I'm not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flam star)
We were born upside-down (I'm a star's star)
Born the wrong way 'round (I’m not a white star)
I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar
I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar
I'm not a pornstar, I'm not a wandering star
I'm a blackstar, I’m a blackstar
​
In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
On the day of execution, only women kneel and smile
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

Starman Lyrics
Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"Lotta soul," he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la

Life on Mars? Lyrics
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

Your Song Lyrics
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in the words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

Rocket Man (I Think It’s Going to Be a Long, Long Time) Lyrics
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Lyrics
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

Bennie and the Jets Lyrics
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots
A mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen

She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, the Jets, the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets

Tiny Dancer Lyrics
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums

But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand

Oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Ooh

Eat, Sleep, Wake (Nothing But You) Lyrics
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you

It's so cold in the air, put the bud in my ear, first note start
I can see where you are, dream where you are
Will the song never end?
Us on the bed half a meter apart

Awkward hearts beating faster and faster, faster and faster
We'll cut through the park, stick to the path
I can't stick to the path, 'cause I dream about nothing but you

Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, nothing but you, nothing but you

I may not say it outwardly
So all I have are memories
Those looks at the start, the words in the dark
But never a flame, we just wanted the spark
Awkward hearts beating faster and faster, faster and faster
We'll cut through the park, stick to the path
I can't stick to the path, 'cause I dream about nothing but you

Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Nothing but you
Nothing but you

Eat, sleep, wake, nothing but you
Eat, sleep, nothing but you, nothing but you, nothing but you

Luna Lyrics
I will bathe myself
Then I'll wear you for the night
Colours fading, frayed at the sides
(You're changing in the light)
Oh why is your face so pale and white?

There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

Now the night has fled
Just like everything I'd said
When the moon was out instead
(Now the sun glows soft and red)
You burn through my mind
Again and again, again, again
And again and again

There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
There's a lot of words to come out
Just waiting for the perfect hideout
Down when the walls start shaking
I'm ready for you to find out
Ah-ooo-ooo
To find out
Ah-ooo-ooo

Always Like This Lyrics
Oh, she can wait
For what I can give
She knows what I am but
She won’t believe me
Is it all okay?
Will I come off the lightest?
I can’t believe it
It’s always like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this)
Kept it at bay
Yes, you kept your words
There on your mouth
But it’s not what I heard
If I follow the light
That I deem the brightest
I won’t believe that
It’s always like this

(No, no, no...)
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I'm not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone
Oh, you can wait
For what I can give
You know what I am
So you know how I live
Try to look proud
But you’re not in the slightest
It's happening now
And it’s always been like this
(Like this, like this, like this...)

I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
I’m not whole
I’m not whole
You waste it all
But I'm not gone

Lights Out, Words Gone Lyrics
Keep your old and wasted word
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on

Can you feel the leeches bite
That boy that she took out tonight
He's brave and walking sure
Through all the spots you're working for

Keep your old and wasted words
My heart is breaking like you heard
But the town has always turned
These lies and made them all burn
Let me be the one, to go on , to go on, to go on
Let me be the one, to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on
When the light is out
And words have gone
Let me be the one to try it on

Shuffle Lyrics
Weight is coming off, soaring high
Pleading you to stay, come alive

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?

Fading at the light
Softly say
Get it out my mind anyway

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'Till it's gone?

You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go
(Running out
You can make it through it
Running out
You can make it all)

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you want to try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you want to

Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Says it's going to heal it, but
You won't make the call (say you)
One step back, you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
Untill it's gone?
Once you get the feeling, it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor (say you)
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'Till it's gone?

Lola Lyrics
I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola
C-O-L-A, Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"
L-O-L-A, Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight, she nearly broke my spine
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh, my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, "Little boy, won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes, well, I almost fell for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Well, I looked at her, and she at me

Well, that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Well, I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never, ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man"
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola
Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo-Lola

Waterloo Sunset Lyrics
Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright

But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night

But I don't feel afraid
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Millions of people swarming like flies
Round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound

And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

Waterloo sunset's fine

Sunny Afternoon Lyrics

The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama tryna break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Tellin' tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now I'm sittin' here
Sippin' at my ice-cold beer
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well, give me two good reasons why I oughta stay
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama tryna break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazin' on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime

Strangers Lyrics
Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things that I own I will share with you
And, if I feel tomorrow, like, I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And, if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die

Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

Cruel Summer Lyrics
Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning, I sit around
Trying to smile, but the air is so heavy and dry

Strange voices are saying (What did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort, this heat has got right out of hand

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

The city is crowded, my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I got to get up and go

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one
It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (It's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone


It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone

You're not the only one

It's a cruel (Cruel), cruel summer

Robert De Niro’s Waiting... Lyrics
Hopes dashed to the floor
Like shattered teenage dreams
Boys living next door
Are never what they seem ooooh
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Talking Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting
I don't want a boy
I've got a man of steel
Don't come any closer
I don't wanna feel, ooh
Your breathing, your touching
But nothing's for free
I never want this to happen to me
Don't try to change me you're wasting your time
Now I've got something much better in mind
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talking Italian (Talking Italian)
Robert De Niro's waiting
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk
Talking OOH!
Talk-talk-talk-talk-talk
Talking
A walk in the park can become a bad dream
People are staring and following me
This is my only escape from it all
Watching a film or a face on the wall
Robert De Niro's waiting

Love in the First Degree Lyrics
Last night I was dreaming
I was locked in a prison cell
When I woke up I was screaming
Calling out your name (whoa)
And the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me (the blame on me)
They wanna tell from my story
They want to hear my plea
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty (guilty)
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree
(Guilty) Of love in the first degree
Someday I'm believing
You will come to my rescue
Unchain my heart, you'll keep him
Let me start a new (you)
The hours passed so slowly
Since they've thrown away the key (away the key)
Can't you see that I'm lonely
Won't you help me please
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty (guilty)
Guilty as a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree
(Guilty) Of Love in the first degree
(Guilty)
Of Love
(Guilty)
Of Love in
(Guilty) Of Love
(Guilty) Of Love in
(Guilty)
Of love in the first degree
And the judge and the jury
They all put the blame on me
They wanna tell from my story
They wanna hear my plea
Only you can set me free
'Cause I'm guilty (Guilty)
As a girl can be
Come on baby, can't you see
I stand accused
Of love in the first degree

I Heard a Rumour Lyrics
Who needs friends who never show
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
Those lonely nights
(I'm just thinking about when I waited)
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out
All my friends were right
('Til I found out, ooh, ooh)
I didn't know you at all
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, ooh
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
Baby, I'm too afraid
So you realise what hurt you made
(So you realise the love)
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
(How can I forgive, ooh, ooh)
It's never gonna be the same
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard it
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
Yes I did, boy ooh, ooh, ooh

Take Me Out Lyrics
So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
I say you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say: take me out


Well, I say you don't know
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

Love Illumination Lyrics
When you're half way from a dream
Is it hard to work out what is real?
Is the real over there
More vivid than here ever feels?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright
You'll be alright

Is the Blackpool bright light
Brighter than the light in your home?
Were you born to be loved
But nobody else seems to know?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason term
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright


We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody
We're all looking for (All looking for)
Somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright

Sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet love

The Dark of the Matinée Lyrics
Take your white finger
Slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer
Relax the fraying wool, slacken ties
And I'm not to look at you in the shoe
But the eyes find the eyes

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine

Time every journey to bump into you accidentally
I charm you and tell you of the boys I hate, all the girls I hate
All the words I hate, all the clothes I hate
How I'll never be anything I hate
You smile, mention something that you like
Oh, how you'd have a happy life if you did the things you like

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine
So I'm on BBC Two now
Telling Terry Wogan how I made it
And what I made is unclear now
But his deference is and his laughter is
My words and smile are so easy now
Yes, it's easy now
Yes, it's easy now

Find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, dark of the matinée
It's better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
You will find me and follow me through corridors, refectories and files
You must follow, leave this academic factory
You will find me in the matinée, the dark of the matinée
Better in the matinée, the dark of the matinée is mine
Yes, it's mine

Always Ascending Lyrics
(Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down)
Don’t be concerned
It’s just the way that gravity works 'round here
All slowly rising, falling patiently
Feel no, feel no fear
Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"
But go
Let go

Always and always and always ascending
The opening line leaves an uncertain ending
Always and always and always ascending
The chords seem to pause, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon, talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh, oh
Yeah, wake me up
C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry, waking up dusty
Feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup, bring me water
We can ascend from this arrangement
We can see fate as entertainment
Bring me a cup, bring me water
Bring me water

Always and always and always ascending
The Shepard misleads so you think you’re transcending
Always and always and always ascending
Pause the progression, but ahh–

Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Never gonna resolve (Never going to resolve)
Ah, talk to me (Talk to me)
C'mon, talk to me (Talk to me)
Yeah, talk to me (Talk to me)
Ahh, oh
Yeah, wake me up
C'mon wake me up
Waking up dry, waking up dusty
Feeling remorse, feeling thirsty
Bring me a cup, bring me water
Yeah, bring me water, yeah, bring me water
Bring me water, bring me water, yeah

(Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down
Put your ladder down, put your ladder down)
Cirrus caress you, cumulus kiss you
Raindrops of crystal whisper, "We’ll miss you"
But go
Let go

Michael waiting on a silver platter now
Nothing matters, oh, nothing matters, oh
Nothing matters, oh yeah

Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God) Lyrics
It doesn't hurt me (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to feel how it feels? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building (Iyoh)
Say, if I only could, oh

You (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Iyeh-yeh-yo)

Oh come on, baby (Iyeh)
Oh come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh, uh-oh
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could, be running up that hill
If I only could, be running up that hill

Wuthering Heights Lyrics
Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master
Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, let me have it!
Let me grab your soul away
Ooh, let me have it!
Let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy!

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy
I’ve come home, I'm so cold...

Babooshka Lyrics
Babooshka
Babooshka

She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do:
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worse move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter:

"All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya"

Babooshka
She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go
To see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out:

"I'm all yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya"
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
Babooshka-ya-ya
Babooshka
Babooshka
Babooshka

This Woman’s Work Lyrics
Pray God you can cope
I stand outside this woman's work
This woman's world
Ooh, it's hard on the man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the father

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying, but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things I should've said
That I never said
All the things we should've done
That we never did
All the things I should've given
But I didn't
Oh, darling, make it go
Make it go away
Give me these moments back
Give them back to me
Give me that little kiss
Give me your hand

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying, but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things we should've said
That were never said
All the things we should've done
That we never did
All the things that you needed from me
All the things that you wanted for me
All the things that I should've given but I didn't
Oh, darling, make it go away
Just make it go away now

Cloudbusting Lyrics
I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark
What made it special
Made it dangerous
So I bury it
And forget

But every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small
In their big black car
To be a threat to the men in power
I hid my yo-yo
In the garden
I can't hide you
From the government
Oh, God, Daddy
I won't forget

'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen


And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, oh
Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
"We're cloudbusting, daddy"
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Yeah, yeah, yay, yo

The sun's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
Your son's coming out
Yeah, yeah, yay-yo

Mathematics Lyrics

Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands left
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the "cha-pow!" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a key
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you at PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
It's mathematics
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science"
"What are we talking about here?"
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science"
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math, do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"

Yo, it's 1 universal law, but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you biddin' for life, mandatory
4 MC's murdered in the last 4 years
I ain't trying to be the 5th when the millennium is here
Yo it's 6 million ways to die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for "Who is" and "Who ain't niggas"
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it
It's all mathematics
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science.."
"What are we talking about here?"
"The Mighty Mos Def"
"It's simple mathematics"
"Check it out"
"I revolve around science.."
"What are we talking about here?"
"Do your math, do your math"
"1, 2, 3, 4"
"What are we talking about here?"

Ms. Fat Booty Lyrics
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

Man, duke, I was in love with this girl,, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name, love? Where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, "Yo, I'm leavin' now"
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
"A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce"
I turned around (Say word!)
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin'? "Oh, I'm fine", my name is Mos "I'm Sharice"
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, "How you gon' leave before you dance with me?"
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though
I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just..
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..

"Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right"
I understand, I'm feelin' you
Besides, "Can I have a dance?" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, "Honey, let's exchange numbers"
Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs
Like, "If I don't, if I don't have you"
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man, I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., "Come now", I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic
Aww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin' ass Asian playin' lay it down and lick me up
What!?

Auditorium Lyrics
Peace
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
Power
Uh
Madlib-erator
Def operator
Rock the data
Amazin' flavor

Yo, the way I feel, sometimes it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face, but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus
The focus get cleared then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly, sometimes y'all don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I'm hardly ever 'sleep, my flow forever deep
And it's volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere; penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life
Holla, black, you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren
I swing 'round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant
Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckas tryin' to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
Then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind 'em
It's everywhere; penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life
Holla, black, you know it well
What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is!
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is!

Ecstatic! (En punto)
Peace, power
Fantastic
So original
And always on time and rockin' ya mind (Ruler!)

Sit and come relax, riddle of the mac
It's the patch, I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well, say, about noon-ish, comin' out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid
Carryin' laundry, "What's wrong, G? Hungry?"
"No, gimme my oil or get  out my country"
And in Arabian barkin' other stuff ("Jihad!")
'Til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust, feelin' like I've pissed upon wound
I'm like, "Surely hope that we can fix our differences soon!" (Bye!)
Buyin' apples, I'm breakin' on, "You take everythin'
Why not just take the damn food, black bastard?"
I don't understand it, on another planet?
15-months of this stuff, how I'm gonna manage?
And increasin' the sentiment, gentlemen
Gettin' down on their Middle Eastern instruments
Realized trapped in this crap
Walk over, kicked one of my fabulous raps ("La-Di-Da-Di")
Arab jaw drop, they well wish, they glad rap
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad
Omar: Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries
Ali: They sent you?
Omar: Yeah, so? Here

What it is, you know, they know
What it is, we know, y'all know
What it is, Ecstatic, there it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you don't know? Here it is
What it is, you know, we know
What it is, they know, y'all know
What it is, you know, here it is

Hip Hop Lyrics
You say "one for the treble, two for the time"
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say "one for the treble, two for the time"
Come on!
Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, (huh!)

My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
From the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)
Full blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (there it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-ga-lish
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunItion
(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you

UMI Says Lyrics
I don't wanna write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now
I don't wanna take no time to write this down
I wanna tell you how I feel right now, hey (World premiere)
Tomorrow may never come
For you or me, life is not promised
Tomorrow may never show up
For you and me, this life is not promised
I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can
With what it is I have
I ain't no perfect man
I'm trying to do, the best that I can
With what it is I have

Put my heart and soul into this song
I hope you feel me
From where I am, to wherever you are
I mean that sincerely
Tomorrow may never come
For you and me, life is not promised
Tomorrow may never appear
You better hold this very moment very close to you
Very close to you, so close to you
So close to you, don't be afraid, just let it shine
My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see

Sometimes I get discouraged
I look around and, things are so weak
People are so weak
Sometimes, sometimes I feel like crying
Sometimes my heart gets heavy
Sometimes I just want to leave and fly away (Like a dove)
Sometimes I don't know what to do with myself
Passion takes over me
I feel like a man, going insane, losing my brain
Trying to maintain, doing my thang
Put my heart and soul into this y'all
I hope you feel me where I am, to wherever you are
Sometimes I don't want to be bothered
Sometimes I just want a quiet life, with
Me and my babies, me and my lady
Sometimes I don't want to get into no war
Sometimes I don't wanna be a soldier
Sometimes I just wanna be a man, but
My Umi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Abi said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My Jiddo said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see
My elders said shine your light on the world
Shine your light for the world to see

I want black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All my people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free, to be free, to be free
All black people to be free
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me
That's all that matters to me

Black people unite and let's all get down
Gotta have what
Gotta have that love
Peace and understanding
One God, one light
One man, one voice, one mic
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and do it right
Black people unite come on and get down
Gotta have what
Love, peace and understanding
One God, one voice, one life
One man, gon' shine my light
Black people unite, now hop up and do it right
Black people unite, now come on and do it right
Yeah baby that's what I like
Yeah baby that's what I like
Black people
My people
Black people
My people
My people
My people

Dreams Lyrics

Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know

The Chain Lyrics
Fuck

Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)


(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow

Landslide Lyrics
I took my love, took it down
I climbed a mountain, and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too


Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder, even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too
I take my love, take it down
Oh, climb a mountain and turn around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down

And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down

Silver Springs Lyrics
You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

Don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Rhiannon Lyrics
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

The Hills Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies (Hide your lies, oh, baby)
Only you to trust, only you
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Main bitch outta your league too, ah

Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah

Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought Mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid

Can’t Feel My Face Lyrics

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "You'll never be alone", oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know (This I know), girl, I know
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "You'll never be alone", oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (But I love it)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (But I love it, but I love it)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (But I love it, but I love it)
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me, "You'll never be alone", oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (But I love it, oh, I love it)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (Said, I can't feel my face)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (But I love it, but I love it)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (But I love it)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
But I love it, but I love it, oh (When I'm with you, baby, when I'm with you, baby)

Reminder Lyrics
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

You know me (Know me, uh, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)
Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, ah, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)
Every time you try to forget who I am (Try to forget who I am)
I'll be right there to remind you again (Hey)
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me, know me)
Why don't you shake somethin', shake somethin'
For the Don? Don't you break nothin', break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin', work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'
Baby girl, won't you shake somethin', shake somethin' (Shake some)
For the Don? Don't you break nothin' (Break nothin'), break nothin'
Baby girl, won't you work somethin' (Work), work somethin'
For the Don? Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'

'Cause you know me
Girl, you know me
You already know me
Yeah, you know me

Call Out My Name Lyrics
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (Call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (Want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (Call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—

I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (Call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you so gently (Ohh)
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (Girl, why can't you wait 'til I?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (Say call out my name, baby)
Girl call out my name and I'll be on my way
And, I'll be on my—

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way

Believer Lyrics
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer413Embed

Thunder Lyrics
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

Demons Lyrics
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide384Embed

Whatever It Takes Lyrics
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes194Embed

Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

Let It Be Lyrics
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be116Embed

Yesterday Lyrics
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Hey Jude Lyrics
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

You have found her, now go and get her

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

Billie Jean Lyrics
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breakin' my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Hoo! She's not at the scene)

Smooth Criminal Lyrics
Ow!
Cha!
Shoo-cha-choo-cha!

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A smooth criminal
Ow!

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?

So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A smooth criminal

Choo-cha, choo-cha
Ow!
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

Ow!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Ow!
Annie, are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie (Dag gone it)
Annie are you okay? (Dag gone it, baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Dag gone it, baby)
There's a sound at the window (Dag gone it, baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie (Hoo! Hoo!)

They Don’t Care About Us Lyrics
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Overlapping voices)

Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me
(We're deep in the fire)

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(We're deep in the fire)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(I'm here to remind you)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
(Don't you sit back and watch the beatin')
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about-
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about-
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’ Lyrics
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)

It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!
Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)

They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!
Aaow!
Hee-haw! (Ooh!)

If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (Yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (Yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)

It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl (Hee-ha)
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

Thriller Lyrics
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow!)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!86Embed

Bohemian Rhapsody Lyrics
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows675Embed

Don’t Stop Me Now Lyrics
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time

And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So (Don't stop me now)

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

Just give me a call

'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now)
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload like an atom bomb
About to oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Love of My Life Lyrics

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back, back) Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how
I still love you (I still love you)

Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Killer Queen Lyrics
She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Ooh, ooh)

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa) Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat (Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you
She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

Another One Bites the Dust Lyrics
Ooh, let's go!

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Shoot out
Ay-yeah

Creep Lyrics
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh

She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo

Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

Karma police, I've given all I can
It's not enough, I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there

I lost myself, I lost myself

No Surprises Lyrics
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent

This is my final fit
My final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden

Paranoid Android Lyrics
Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head

What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)

When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all

What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You don't remember, you don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it, sir, you're leaving (Rain down)
The crackle of pigskin (Rain down)
The dust and the screaming (Come on, rain down)
The yuppies networking (On me)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)
The panic, the vomit (From a great height)

Exit Music (For A Film) Lyrics
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill

And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke82Embed

​when the party’s over Lyrics
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that456Embed

​bad guy Lyrics
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad338Embed

​everything i wanted Lyrics
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?300Embed

Happier Than Ever Lyrics
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)292Embed

​idontwannabeyouanymore Lyrics
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore

Hands, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you

Common People Lyrics
She came from Greece, she had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martin's College
That's where I
Caught her eye
She told me that her Dad was loaded
I said "In that case, I'll have rum and Coca-Cola"
She said "fine"
And then in thirty seconds time she said

"I wanna live like common people
I wanna do whatever common people do
Wanna sleep with common people
I wanna sleep with common people like you."
Well,​ what else could I do?
I said "I'll... I'll see what I can do"

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said "pretend you got no money"
And she just laughed and said "oh, you're so funny"
I said "yeah...
Well, I can't see anyone else smiling in here
Are you sure
You wanna live like common people
You wanna see whatever common people see
Wanna sleep with common people
You wanna sleep with common people like me?
But she didn’t understand
And she just smiled and held my hand

Oh, rent a flat above a shop
And cut your hair and get a job
And smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah

You'll never live like common people
You'll never do what ever common people do
Never fail like common people
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And then dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do
Oh!

Sing along with the common people
Sing along and it might just get you through
Laugh along with the common people
Laugh along, even though they're, they're laughing at you
And the stupid things that you do
Because you think that poor is cool

Like a dog lying in a corner
They will bite you and never warn you
Look out, they'll tear your insides out
'Cause everybody hates a tourist
Especially one who, who thinks it's all such a laugh
Yeah, and the chip stain's and grease will come out in the bath
You will never understand
How it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control
And with nowhere left to go
You are amazed that they exist
And they burn so bright whilst you can only wonder why

Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
And smoke some fags and play some pool
Pretend you never went to school
But still you'll never get it right
'Cause when you're laid in bed at night
Watching roaches climb the wall
If you called your dad he could stop it all, yeah
Never live like common people
Never do what common people do
Never fail like common people
Never watch your life slide out of view
And then dance, and drink, and screw
Because there's nothing else to do

Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
Wanna live with common people like you
A la la la la la

Disco 2000 Lyrics
Oh, we were born within one hour of each other
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
Your name is Deborah, Deborah
It never suited ya
And they said that when we grew up
We'd get married and never split up
Oh, we never did it
Although I often thought of it

Oh, Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small
With woodchip on the wall
When I came round to call
You didn't notice me at all
And I said

Let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago
You were the first girl at school to get breasts
And Martyn said that you were the best
Oh, the boys all loved you but I was a mess
I had to watch them try and get you undressed
We were friends, that was as far as it went
I used to walk you home sometimes, but it meant
Oh, it meant nothing to you
'Cos you were so popular

Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small
With woodchip on the wall
When I came around to call
You didn't notice me at all
And I said

Let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago
Do it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh, Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small
With woodchip on the wall
And when I came around to call
You didn't notice me at all
And I said

Let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago

Oh, what are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
What are you doing Sunday, baby?
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby

Like a Friend Lyrics
Don't bother saying you're sorry
Why don't you come in?
Smoke all my cigarettes again
Every time I get no further
How long has it been?
Come on in now
Wipe your feet on my dreams

You take up my time
Like some cheap magazine
When I coulda been learning something
Oh well, you know what I mean
I've done this before
And I will do it again
Come on and kill me, baby
While you smile like a friend
Oh, and I'll come running
Just to do it again

You are that last drink I never should have drunk
You are the body hidden in the trunk
You are the habit I can't seem to kick
You are my secrets on the front page every week
You are the car I never should have bought
You are the train I never should have caught
You are the cut that makes me hide my face
You are the party that makes me feel my age
And like a car crash I can see but I just can't avoid
Like a plane I've been told I never should board
Like a film that's so bad but I gotta stay till the end
Let me tell you now, it's lucky for you that we're friends
And like a car crash I can see but I just can't avoid
Like a plane I've been told I never should board
Like a film that's so bad but I gotta stay till the end
Let me tell you now, it's lucky for you that we're friends7Embed

Babies Lyrics
Well, it happened years ago
When you lived on Stanhope Road
We listened to your sister
When she came from school
'Cos she was two years older
And she had boys in her room
I listened outside, I heard her
Alright
Well, that was all right for a while
But soon I wanted more
I wanna see as well as hear and so I
I hid inside her wardrobe
As she came home round four
And she was with some kid called David
Oh, from the garage up the road
I listened outside, I heard her
Alright
Oh, I wanna take you home
I wanna give you children
And you might be my girlfriend
A-yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I saw you next day
I really couldn't tell
'Cos you might go and tell your mother
And so you went with Neve
Oh yeah, and Neve was coming on
And I thought I heard you laughing
When his mum and dad were gone
I listened outside, I heard you
Alright
Oh, I wanna take you home
I wanna give you children
And you might be my girlfriend
A-yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh well, I guess
It couldn't last too long
I came home one day
And all her things were gone
I fell asleep inside
I never heard her come
Oh, and I opened up the wardrobe
And I had to get it on, yeah
Oh, listen
Oh, we were on the bed when you came home
I heard you stop outside the door
I know you won't believe it's true
I only went with her 'cos she looks like you
My god!
Oh, I wanna take you home
I wanna give you children
And you might be my girlfriend
A-yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Do You Remember The First Time? Lyrics
You say you've got to go home
'Cos he's sitting on his own again this evening
And I know you're gonna let him bore your pants off again
Oh, now it's half past eight, you'll be late
Oh, but you say you're not sure
Though it makes good sense for you to live together
Still you bought a toy that can reach the places he never goes
And now it's getting late, he's so straight
Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
Oh, but you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now, I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah, now
Ooh
You wanna go home
Well, at least there's someone there that you can talk to
And you never have to face up to the night on your own
Jesus, it must be great to be straight
Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
Oh, but you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now, I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah, now
Ooh
You wanna go home
Oh yeah, you wanna go home
Oh yeah, you wanna go home
You wanna go home
Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
But you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now, I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me, oh yeah, now
Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
Oh, but you know that we've changed so much since then

No, I don't care if you screw him

I Want You Back Lyrics
Uh-huh huh huh huh
Let me tell ya now
Uh-huh

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back)

Yes, I do now (I want you back)
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back)
Na, na, na, na

Tryin' to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now
Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance (To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (Let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh-huh

A buh buh buh buh
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need
A buh buh buh buh, all I want
A buh buh buh buh, all I need

Oh, just one more chance
To show you that I love you
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
I want you back

Forget what happened then
I want you back

Let me live again
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back

Spare me of this 'cause

Gimme back what I lost

Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you
(Baby!) Oh! (Baby!) Oh! (Baby!) Oh!
I want you back!

Forget what happened then

I want you back!

And let me live again
Oh, I want you back! Ha!30Embed

ABC Lyrics
A buh-buh buh buh
A buh-buh buh buh

You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like "I before E, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now now now, I'm gonna teach you (Teach you, teach you)
All about love, yeah! (All about love!)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as Do-Re-Mi
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me, girl!
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as Do-Re-Mi
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me, girl!

Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
Come on, let me love you just a little bit!
I'ma gonna teach how to sing it out!
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!
Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, girl
Your education ain't complete
T-t-t-teachers gonna show you (Show you, show you)
How to get an "A"! (Nyah nyah nyah nyah!)
Spell me, you (You add the two)
Listen to me baby, that's all you gotta do!

A, B, C
It's easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as Do-Re-Mi
A, B, C, 1, 2, 3, baby you and me, girl!

A, B, C, it's easy, it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
Now, that's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, you and me (Yeah)

Sit down, girl!
I think I love you!
No!
Get up, girl!
Show me what you can do!
Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now!
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh-ooh!
Shake it, shake it, baby, huh!
1, 2, 3, baby, ooh-ooh
A, B, C, baby, nah nah!
Do-Re-Mi, baby, huh!
That's how easy love can be

That's how easy love can be

I'm-a gonna teach you how to sing it out!
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about!

Sing a simple melody

Who’s Lovin’ You Lyrics
When I (when I) had you (had you)
I treated you bad
And wrong, my dear
And girl since
Since you went away

Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you

I, I, I, I
Should have never ever
Ever made you cry
And girl since
Since you been gone

Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you
Life without love
Is oh, so lonely
I don't think
I don't think
I'm gonna make it
All my life (all my life)
All my life, yeah (all my life)
Belongs to you only
Come on and take it, girl
Come on and take it
Because
{Verse 3}
All
All I can do
All I can do
Since you've been gone is cry
And you, oooh
Will never wonder
And worry your pretty little head
About what I do

Don't you know I
Sit around
With my head hangin' down
And I wonder
Who's lovin' you10Embed

Never Can Say Goodbye Lyrics
Never can say goodbye
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
No, no, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye
(Never can say goodbye, girl)

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why (Tell me why)
Is it so (Is it so)

That I never can say goodbye
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
No, no, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye
(Never can say goodbye, girl)

Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercin' me right to the core
It says, "Turn around you fool
You know you love her more and more"
Tell me why (Tell me why)
Is it so (Is it so)
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
Ooh ooh baby
(Don't wanna let you go, girl)
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no (No no no)
Ooh, oh
I never can say goodbye, girl
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
Ooh ooh
(Don't wanna let you go, girl)
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, ooh (No no no)
Never can say goodbye
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
No, no, no, no, I
Never can say goodbye
(Never can say goodbye, girl)

I keep thinkin' that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hang up
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why (Tell me why) is it so (Is it so)
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
Ooh ooh baby (Baby)
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, ooh (No no no)
Oh, I never can say you goodbye, girl
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
Ooh, oh (Hey, baby)
I never can say you goodbye
No no no, no no no, ooh, ow, yeah (No no no)
I never can say goodbye, girl
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
Ooh ooh baby (Hey, baby)
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, ooh, ooh (No no no)
I never can say goodbye girl
(Never can say goodbye, girl)
Ooh, now, ha (Hey, baby)
I never can say goodbye9Embed

Almost Blue Lyrics
Almost blue
Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you
Almost all the things that you promised with your eyes
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be
Almost blue
Almost touching it will almost do
There's a part of me thats always true... always
All the things that you promised with your eyes
I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying
Almost you
Almost me

There Will Never Be Another You Lyrics

There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you


Yes I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you2Embed

My Funny Valentine Lyrics
My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day4Embed

But Not For Me Lyrics
They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me
I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me2Embed
