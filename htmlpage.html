	<p>To access the HTML code of any saved HTML file, right-click the file and open it with a text editor such as Notepad. Once you are done editing, save the file and reopen the HTML page in a browser.</p>

        <p>This is a 'div' element! We can easily change the content here. <i>This is italic text.</i> <strong>This is bold text.</strong><br>
        There are other styles as well, like <u>underlined text</u> and <s>strikethrough</s>. You can also <b><i>combine styles</i></b>. <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">This is a link to Google</a>. The target attribute makes it open in a new tab or window.</p>
	<!-- When you combine tags, it is good practice to close them so that the most recent tag is closed first -->

        <h2>This is a smaller heading</h2>

        <p>This is regular text in a paragraph.</p>
	<!-- Every paragraph starts and ends with a p tag. The tag with the forward slash is the closing tag -->

	<p><b>This is another way to make bold text!</b></p>

	<p><ul>If you want to make a list:
		<li>This is one option</li>
		<li>These are bullet points</li>
		<li>The intendations in the code are not necessary but they make the code more readable</li>
		<li>"ul" stands for "unordered list"</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p><ol>Another list:
		<li>You guessed it!</li>
		<li>This list is numbered</li>
		<li>"ol" stands for "ordered list"</li>
	</ol></p>

	<p>Sometimes you might also need to include <q>quotations</q>.</p>

	<p><blockquote>A longer quote, such as one that spans an entire paragraph, should be done with the blockquote tag. It creates an automatic indentation and nicely sets a quotation apart from the main text. Depending on the style settings in place, it sometimes also reduces the line spacing slightly.</blockquote></p>

	<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">It is also possible to change the colour of the font, but that can look kind of tacky.</p>
